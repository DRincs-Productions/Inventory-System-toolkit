This repo is a complete set of tools to create a game where you can explore and relate to characters.

In order to simplify the update work and avoid errors in saving I created functions that check the correct state of variables by inserting them in [after_load](game/tool/core.rpy#L1) (e.g. after a change to a quest that causes a stage to be blocked, the quest should restart) and an abundant use of define.

Feel free to contribute, fork this and send a pull request. ðŸ˜„

## Insert Toolkit in your project

I recommend the following ways to include it in your project:

- [**Pull branch**](#pull-branch) (to **insert** it into your game and **update** it easily)
- [**Fork**](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) (to improve the repo or create a Toolkit based on mine)
- [Manually](https://github.com/DRincs-Productions/Inventory-System-toolkit/releases) (not recommended)


### Pull branch

To **insert** or **update** the Toolkit in your repo with Pull branch I recommend the following procedure:

(only if you want to insert the repo) Create a new empty branch, in the example I'll use **Inventory-toolkit**

```shell
git checkout -b Inventory-toolkit
git checkout Inventory-toolkit
git pull https://github.com/DRincs-Productions/Inventory-System-toolkit.git tool-only --allow-unrelated-histories

```

At the end make a merge inside the arm of the project.
